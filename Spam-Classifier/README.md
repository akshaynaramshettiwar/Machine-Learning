# End to End project on Email classifier

###This Jupyter notebook compares various ML algorithms to classify SMS messages as spam or not. 
The notebook begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including visualizations and data preprocessing. Models trained and tested include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and XGBoost Classifier. 

I was able to get 100% precision with about 97.1% accuracy for my predictions.
